# Note On AI
- Generative AI is being used for workflow automation, file creation, and note transcription.
- Some notes files use AI to fetch additional information for future reference and search.
- Not all AI-generated information is guaranteed accurate; personal fact-checking is being done but not guarenteed.
- AI tools are being integrated to enhance my learning and work speed.
- AI is not used for coursework; classwork projects are 100% my own unless additional contributors otherwise credited.
