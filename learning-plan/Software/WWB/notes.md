# Notes: WWB (Wireless Workbench)

## What is Wireless Workbench?

WWB enables users to:


- **Coordinate frequencies**
	- Scan the RF environment to identify available frequencies
	- Automatically assign compatible frequencies to all devices
	- Avoid interference and optimize spectrum usage
    - Can grab frequency coordination data from previous shows by others

- **Configure devices**
	- Remotely set up and adjust wireless transmitters and receivers
	- Push configuration changes to multiple devices at once

- **Monitor in real time**
	- Track RF signal strength, battery status, and audio levels
	- Receive alerts for dropouts, low battery, or interference
	- Log and review performance data during events

- **Frequency cordination**
    - The noise floor is generated during a scan and the goal will be to find frequencies that do not have additional signal on them above the noise floor.
    - Calculate and deploy the frequencies
        - Consider if there are tv chanel regulation or licencing requirments for the area

- **Ad600**
    - It can perform continuous detailed scans, identify sources of interference, and help optimize frequency coordination.
    - Does not allow for transmitter wirless updates, but will be able to instantly identify new interference sources during a show and give solution frequencies
