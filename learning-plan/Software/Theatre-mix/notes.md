# Notes: Theatre Mix

TheatreMix is designed specifically for theatrical sound mixing on less advanced boards, enabling engineers to efficiently manage large numbers of wireless microphones and complex cue sequences. By automating DCA assignments and cue management, it streamlines the process of mixing live theatre when the console do not have a built in cue system.

In our workflow, TheatreMix would be used to pre-program cues and DCA assignments offline, allowing us to mark up scripts and plan mixes before stepping into the venue. During rehearsals and performances, we  connect TheatreMix to our console to trigger cues, monitor channel health, and make live adjustments as needed. The programming is very fast and only costs roughtly $7 a week only for time that you connect it to a board.

## Key Features
- **DCA Cue Automation:** Creates and runs DCA cues for up to 48 channels, automating assignments and mutes for wireless microphones and other sources.
- **Offline Programming:** Enables rapid show programming on a laptop, letting you mark up scripts and prepare cues without needing the console present.
- **Remote & Playback Control:** Integrates with playback software (like QLab) and supports remote control via OSC and REAPER link.
- **Live Editing:** Allows real-time updates to cues directly from the console during rehearsals or performances.
- **Channel Monitoring:** Monitors input meters for dropouts and clipping, helping identify wireless mic issues before they impact the show.
- **Advanced Cue List:** Provides a visual cue list with DCA assignments, color coding, and easy editing for efficient show management.
- **Ensemble Groups & Actor Profiles:** Supports ensemble channel assignments and actor-specific processing profiles for flexible show setups.
- **Position Presets & FX Routing:** Manages channel delay, pan, and effects assignments for precise sound design.

## Typical Usage
- Program cues and DCA assignments offline, referencing the show script.
- Connect to your digital console for rehearsals and performances.
- Use the cue list to trigger scene changes, manage DCA assignments, and monitor channel health.
- Make live edits as needed during tech week or performances.
- Integrate with playback and automation systems for a seamless show experience.
